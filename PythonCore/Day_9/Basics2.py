# Programming exercises Variables, Operators, Strings 

# 1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.
'''
a = 14
b = 20
print(f"addition of a: {a} and b: {b} is {a + b}")
print(f"Dividing the sum: {a + b} by 2 give {(a+b)/2}")

'''

# 2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

''' 
a = 23
b = 7

print(f"Two numbers are a: {a} and b: {b}")
print(f"addition: {a + b}")
print(f"substraction: {a - b}")
print(f"multiplication: {a * b}")
print(f"division: {a / b:.3f}")
print(f"remainder: {a % b}")

'''

# 3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.

''' 
name = "Adarsh Pandey"
print(f"My name is: {name}, Hii")

'''

# 4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.

'''
a, b, c = "samosa", "jalebi", "halwa"
print(f" food items are: {a}, {b}, {c}")

'''

# 5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.

'''
print(f"Hello " * 10)

'''

# 6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment

'''
name, age = "Adarsh Pandey", 22

print(f" Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

'''

# 7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.

'''
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "Brother"

combine = str1 + " " + str2

print(f" Combined two strings are: {combine}")

'''

# 8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.

'''
string = "Programming"

print(f"fourth word of string: {string} is {string[3]}")

'''

# 9. Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.

'''
# in slicing it includes the start index but excludes the end index
string = "Development"
print(f"letter from string: {string} from 0 to 5 is {string[0:6]}")

'''

# 10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.

'''
string = "Application"
print(f"Letter from string: {string} from index 1 to end is {string[1:]}")

'''
